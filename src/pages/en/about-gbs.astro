It is the leading cause of acute, non-trauma-related paralysis worldwide.</p></div>`

    content: `<div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed"><p>The most accepted theory is <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">"molecular mimicry"</strong>. Often, the syndrome begins after a common infection, like a stomach bug (*Campylobacter jejuni*) or a respiratory virus.</p><p>The immune system creates antibodies to fight the germ, but some parts of the germ look remarkably similar to our own nerve cells. The antibodies make a catastrophic error and begin attacking the healthy nerves, leading to the weakness, numbness, and paralysis that define GBS.</p></div>`

Scientists are working to find faster diagnostic tools and develop new, more targeted therapies. Your support helps fuel this vital research and brings hope to every person affected by GBS.</p>`

    content: `<p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Symptoms often begin with tingling in the feet and hands, quickly followed by muscle weakness that spreads upwards over hours or days. At its most severe, GBS can be devastating:</p><ul class="space-y-4">...</ul>` // Note: The detailed list with SVGs is complex for a string, you might want to simplify or build this part differently if needed.
